# Hyperparameter-tuning-in-XGBoost-using-genetic-algorithm
We will use genetic algorithm for hyperparameter tuning in XGBoost. The dataset is from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/musk/.
It contains a set of 102 molecules, out of which 39 are identified by humans as 
having odor that can be used in perfumery and 69 having not the desired odor.
The dataset contains 6,590 low-energy conformations of these molecules, contianing 166 features.
